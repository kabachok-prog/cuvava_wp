    2. Information We Collect Through Automated Means <br>
    MDsimple and our services providers (third party companies that work on our behalf) use a variety of technologies to
    assist in collecting information about your use of the Services and the devices you use to access the Services.
    Visitor Data. When you use our Website, we collect information that will help us understand and analyze your
    experience interacting with our Services. For example, we may collect information related to domain names, the type
    of browsers used to access the Services, operating system software, browser plug-ins, cookie preferences, search
    engine keywords, the pages you viewed and amount of time spent on particular pages, terms you use in you searches on
    our Website, and similar information. <br>
    Location Information. When you use the Services, we and our service providers may automatically collect general
    location information (e.g., IP address, city/state and or postal code associated with an IP address) from your
    computer or mobile device. This information allows us to enable access to content that varies based on a user’s
    general location (e.g., to provide you with accurate sales tax information and to deliver content customized to your
    location).
    Cookies. “Cookies” are a feature in your browser software. If enabled, we, or our service providers, may write
    cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of the Website.
    Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on
    past visits. When you visit this Website again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your
    preferences. <br>
    We may use cookies to: <br><br>

    <ul class="privacy__list">
        <li class="privacy__list-item">keep track of the number of return visits to this Website;</li>
        <li class="privacy__list-item">accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on Website usage;</li>
        <li class="privacy__list-item">deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; and
        </li>
        <li class="privacy__list-item">save your password for ease of access to the Website.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="privacy">

    You can disable cookies, although the Website may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be
    modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about
    cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of MDsimple’s Website, you
    need to accept cookies. <br>
    Web Beacons. A web beacon, sometimes called a tracking pixels, is a programming code that can be used to display an
    image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you
    with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows MDsimple and our third-party service
    providers to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing
    purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, we
    also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in MDsimple’s database.
    Other Online Tools. MDsimple may also use a web server log or an SDK. A web server log is a file where website activity
    is stored. An SDK is a set of tools and/or code that we embed in our software to allow third parties to collect
    information about how people interact with our Services. <br>
    As we continue to develop the Website and our Services, MDsimple may implement additional methods to gather information
    about the MDsimple community. <br><br>

    3. Information We Collect From Social Media and other Content Platforms <br>
    MDsimple maintains a presence on a variety of social media platforms. When you “like” or “follow” us on Facebook,
    Instagram, Twitter, or other social media platforms, we may collect some information about you. This information
    includes your name, email address, any comments or content you post that is relevant to MDsimple. We also collect your
    information if you sign up for a promotion and submit information to us through one of our social media accounts.
    MDsimple also maintains several blogs as a part of its Services. When you comment or post content to any of our blogs,
    we will collect your name and email address. <br><br>

    4. Information We Receive From Other Sources <br>
    MDsimple works closely with third parties (including, for example, physicians, cannabis experts, and dispensaries with
    whom we partner to provide you with the Services and their healthcare services, subcontractors in software engineering,
    advertising networks, analytics, and search information providers). These third-parties may provide MDsimple with some
    additional information about you. <br><br>

    HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<br><br>

    The following paragraphs describe how MDsimple uses your information in connection with our Services.
    General Use. MDsimple will use your information as necessary to carry out and manage its Services. This includes, using
    your information to verify and administer your account, including processing payments and fulfilling orders (if
    applicable). We will use your information to communicate with you about MDsimple’s Services, your use of the Services or
    your inquiries related to the Services. We will send you communications on behalf of physicians or other medical
    marijuana consultants so that the Services satisfy your needs. MDsimple will use your information to ensure that content
    from our Services is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or device, allow you to
    participate in interactive features of our Services (when you choose to do so), and as part of our efforts to keep our
    Services safe and secure.<br><br>

    Medical Marijuana Evaluations & Personalized Consultations. MDsimple will use your information to facilitate healthcare
    providers conducting their medical evaluations. Likewise, we will use your information to assist consultants in
    providing individualized marijuana consultations. MDsimple is the platform that providers/consultants use to communicate
    with you. MDsimple is not associated in any way with any of the providers/consultants.<br><br>

    Improve MDsimple’s Services. MDsimple continuously seeks to improve its Services. To do so, we conduct research to
    understand the effectiveness of our Services, improve our Services, and to better understand the MDsimple community. If
    we publish the results of our research to others, such research will be presented in a de-identified and aggregate form
    such that individual users cannot be identified.
    Promotional Communications. We will use your personal information to communicate with you by email, postal mail, phone,
    or text message about surveys, promotions, special events or our products and Services and those of our affiliates or
    third-party partners, and any of their related businesses. By creating an account and using this Website, you are giving
    your express permission to MDsimple and their agents or vendors the right to contact you with targeted advertising
    materials by email, text message (SMS), telephone or cellphone, including the use of automated, predictive,
    programmable, or similar (“robodialers”) dialers or dialing software, or any other means of communication to provide
    promotional offers. To the extent applicable, you expressly acknowledge that you are solely responsible for all charges
    billed by your mobile service provider. If you no longer wish to receive promotional communications by email, please
    follow the unsubscribe link located at the end of the email message.<br><br>

    Marketing/Performance Analysis & Data Analytics. We will use your information to help us better understand your
    interests and needs, such as by engaging in analysis and research regarding use of the Services. We may use your
    information to measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising and content we serve to you and others, and to
    deliver and customize relevant advertising and content to you.
    Combined Information. For the purposes discussed in this Privacy Policy, we may combine the information that we collect
    through the Services with information that we receive from other sources, both online and offline, and use and share
    such combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

    Aggregate/De-Identified Data. We may aggregate and/or de-identify any information collected through the Services so that
    such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate/De-Identified Information”). We may use
    Aggregate/De-Identified Information for any purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and may also share
    such data with any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors. We may receive monetary
    and/or other compensation for sharing Aggregate/De-Identified Information with such third parties.<br><br>

    DATA ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING<br><br>

    1. Data Analytics<br>
    We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics (including Google Signals, Google
    User-ID, and other Google Analytics features) and MixPanel) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information
    through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; try to
    locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices to better tailor services and features; and provide
    certain features to you. If you have a Google account with personalized advertising enabled, through Google Signals,
    Google will also be able to gather for us analytics and engagement information from across the various devices you use
    to access the Services. To prevent Google from using your information for analytics (including cross-device tracking for
    personalization purposes), you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. And to opt out of Google
    Signals, please open your “Settings” app, locate and tap “Google,” select “Ads,” and turn ON “Opt out of Ads
    Personalization.” You may also be able to disable cross-device tracking through your Android or Apple device-based
    settings.<br>
    If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you
    open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of
    our communications and marketing campaigns.<br><br>

    2. Online Advertising<br>
    The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Facebook,
    Google Ad Words, Criteo and others) that use cookies and other technologies to deliver relevant content and advertising
    for Ro products on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be
    based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your searches,
    demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your
    activity over time and across other websites and online services.<br>
    We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this
    information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide
    you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.<br>
    We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that
    may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third party advertising network services.
    If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies
    from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s
    Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of
    receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. If you are interested in more
    information about Criteo’s privacy practices or opting-out of Criteo’s advertising services, you may view their Privacy
    Policy. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google
    Ads Settings page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in
    these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
    availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.<br>
    Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services,
    but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.<br><br>

    3. Mobile Advertising<br>
    When using mobile applications from us or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may
    use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics.
    Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its
    own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the
    applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you
    should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. You
    may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored
    in-app advertisements.<br><br>

    4. Notice Concerning Do Not Track<br>
    Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing
    you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we
    provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to
    browser-initiated DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.<br><br>

    HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION<br><br>

    Veriheal may share your information in the following ways:<br>
    Affiliates & Related Business Entities. We may share the information we collect with our affiliates or related business
    entities for the purposes of delivering products or services to you, ensuring a consistent level of service, and to
    enhance our products, services, and your customer experience.<br>
    Healthcare Providers, Consultants, and Services. We may share your information with healthcare providers in order to
    schedule and fulfill appointments so that the healthcare providers may provide medical marijuana evaluations or
    personalized consultations.<br>
    Service Providers and Third-Party Vendors. We provide access to or share your information with select third parties who
    use the information to perform services on our behalf. They provide a variety of services to us, including billing,
    sales, marketing, advertising, analytics, research, customer service, shipping and fulfillment, data storage, IT and
    security, fraud prevention, payment processing, and auditing and legal services. These entities may also include health
    care organizations and other third parties we use to support our business or in connection with the administration and
    support of the Services.<br><br>

    Legal Compliance. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain, and disclose information
    we collect and maintain about you if reasonably necessary to comply with a subpoena or court order, to enforce our Terms
    of Use, Privacy Policy, or MDsimple’s legal rights.<br><br>

    Business Transfers. As MDsimple continues to grow, we may buy, merge, or partner with other companies. In such
    transactions, your information may be among the assets that are transferred.<br><br>

    Public Forums. Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share comments publicly with other users.
    Any information that you submit through such features is not confidential, and we may use it for any purpose (including
    in testimonials or other marketing materials). For example, if you submit a product review on one of our Websites or
    blogs, we may display your review (along with the name provided, if any) on other MDsimple websites and on third-party
    websites. Any information you post openly in these ways will be available to the public at large and potentially
    accessible through third-party search engines. Accordingly, please take care when using these features.<br>
    Aggregate/De-Identified Information. We reserve the right to create Aggregate/De-Identified Data from the information we
    collect through the services and our sharing of such Aggregate/De-Identified Data is in our sole discretion. We may
    receive monetary and/or other compensation for our sharing of such Aggregate/De-Identified Information.<br><br>

    THIRD PARTY LINKS AND CONTENT<br><br>

    The Website and email messages that you receive from Veriheal may sometimes contain hypertext links to the websites of
    third parties. MDsimple is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. Linked
    websites may contain links to websites maintained by third parties. Such links are provided for your convenience and
    reference only. MDsimple does not operate or control in any respect any information, software, products or services
    available on such third party websites. The inclusion of a link to a website does not imply any endorsement of the
    services or the site, its contents, or its sponsoring organization.<br><br>

    HOW DO WE PROTECT COLLECTED PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br><br>

    1. Our Data Security Program<br>
    We have adopted, implemented and maintain an enterprise-wide corporate information security and privacy program that
    includes technical, organizational, administrative, and other security measures designed to protect, as required by
    applicable law, against reasonably anticipated or actual threats to the security of your personal information (the
    “Security Program”). Our Security Program was created by reference to the obligations set forth under the Health
    Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). It includes, among many other things, procedures for assessing
    the need for, and as appropriate, either employing encryption and multi-factor authentication or using equivalent
    compensating controls. We therefore have every reason to believe our Security Program is reasonable and appropriate for
    our business and the nature of foreseeable risks to the personal information we collect. We further periodically review
    and update our Security Program, including as required by applicable law.<br><br>

    2. Our Incident Response and Management Plan<br>
    Despite the significant investment we’ve made in, and our commitment to, the Security Program we cannot guarantee that
    your personal information, whether during transmission or while stored on our systems, otherwise in our care, or the
    care of our third-party vendors and service providers, will be free from either failed or successful attempts at
    unauthorized access or that loss or accidental destruction will never occur. Except for our duty under applicable law to
    maintain the Security Program, we necessarily disclaim, to the maximum extent the law allows, any other liability for
    any such theft or loss of, unauthorized access or damage to, or interception of any data or communications including
    personal information.<br><br>

    All that said, as part of our Security Program, we have specific incident response and management procedures that are
    activated whenever we become aware that your personal information was likely to have been compromised. Those procedures
    include mechanisms to provide, when circumstances and/or our legal obligations warrant, notice to all affected data
    subjects within the timeframes required by law, as well as to give them such other mitigation and protection services
    (such as the credit monitoring and ID theft insurance) as may be required by applicable law. We further require in the
    contracts with our vendors and business partners that they notify us immediately if they have any reason to believe that
    an incident adversely affecting personal information we provided to them has occurred.<br><br>

    SUBMITTING INFORMATION FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES<br><br>

    We control and operate the online and mobile resources from within the United States of America (the “U.S.”).
    Information collected through the Website and Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other
    country in which we or our vendors maintain facilities. Although we do not actively block or monitor visitors from other
    countries, the Website is directed only at visitors from the U.S. As such, this Privacy Policy is consistent with U.S.
    law and practice and is not adapted to other laws (including European data security and privacy laws). Veriheal will
    apply the applicable laws of the U.S. including as embodied in this Privacy Policy in place of data protections under
    your home country’s law. That is, you freely and unambiguously acknowledge that this Privacy Policy, not your home
    country’s laws, controls how we will collect, store, process, and transfer your personal information. Similarly, the
    English language version of this Privacy Policy is the controlling version regardless of any translation you may
    attempt.<br><br>

    DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION LAWS: THE CCPA AND GDPR<br><br>

    Privacy and data protection laws vary around the world and among the several United States. Some of those laws are more
    specific than others. Most prominently, residents of California and data subjects whose personal information was
    obtained from them while they were in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland have certain
    additional rights in cases where the party collecting that information is governed by the applicable law. We have
    reviewed our business operations and data-related business practices with legal counsel in the context of the General
    Data Protection Regulation under European Law also known as the “GDPR” and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the
    “CCPA”). As a result of that review, as of the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we do not believe we are governed
    by either the GDPR or CCPA.<br>
    We do not, for instance, collect personal information from data subjects in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom,
    or Switzerland or elsewhere abroad. Similarly, we do not target or tailor our Website or Services or any of our other
    US-based business activities to appeal to, or specifically attempt to do business in those jurisdictions. In terms of
    California, although we may do business within the state, we do not meet any of the various statutory thresholds and
    criteria that would bring us under the CCPA.<br><br>

    For general visitors, consumers and regulators who have questions about whether or how the GDPR, CCPA or other industry-
    or jurisdiction-specific laws apply to us, you can contact us using the contact information below.<br><br>

    CHILDREN’S PRIVACY<br><br>

    Federal law imposes special restrictions and obligations on commercial website operators who direct their operations
    toward, and collect and use information from children under the age of 13. We take those age-related requirements very
    seriously, and, consistent with them, do not intend for our Website or Services to be used by children under the age of
    18, and certainly not by anyone under the age of 13. Moreover, we do not knowingly collect personal information from
    minors under the age of 18. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 18 has submitted personal information to us
    via our Website or Services, we will delete that information and not use it for any purpose whatsoever. We encourage
    parents and legal guardians to talk with their children about the potential risks of providing personal information over
    the Internet.<br><br>

    CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT<br><br>

    We reserve the right to change or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check our Website periodically
    for such changes since all information collected is subject to the Privacy Policy in place at the time of collection.
    Typically, we will indicate the effective/amendment date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. If we feel it is
    appropriate, or if the law requires, we’ll also provide a summary of changes we’ve made near the end of the new Privacy
    Policy.<br><br>

    Payment: MDsimple does not refund the doctor's consultation fee, only the doctor decides if the patient is eligible for
    medical marijuana card approval.<br><br>
